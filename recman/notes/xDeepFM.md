# xDeepFM

## Introduction



Seeing the word xDeepFM, it is easy to think of it. This model is probably composed of three parts. 
They are, *x, deep, fm*. Corresponding to the context of the deep neural network, **deep** stands for Multilayer perceptron, FM refers to factorization machine. x stands for extreme. 
It seems that this name seems to be the enhanced version of DeepFM, but in fact, and his real first-degree close relatives should be Deep&Cross Network, then DeepFM.
